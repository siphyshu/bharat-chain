## Alliance

This project has the potential to serve any number of supply chains in all industries, big or small. This can be offered as a SaaS solution to brands wanting to manage their supply chain and keep it transparent. As well as, to sellers and manufacturers that wish to track their goods. This is already being done at a very large scale outside India, leveraging the power of Web3. But, it has not been adapted to the meet the tailored needs of the Indian industries. We can seize that opportunity.
